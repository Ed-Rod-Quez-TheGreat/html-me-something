			<h1>The tale of Edward the Annoying</h1>
			<h4>(and his neverending quest for world irritation)</h4>
		</header>
		<p> Legends tell of a man... A man whose mannerismns are so vexing, his demeanor so irksome, and personality so maddening, that none alive can withstand his trying presence for more than a few moments before decending into gibbering hysterics. <br> <br>...This is his story.

		<h2> The origins of "He who shall Annoy"</h2>
		<p> There are conflicting accounts as to how this natural disaster of displeasurement first arrived on our world:<br> Some stories tell of a dark ritual performed by a coven of mimes who wished revenge on the speaking world... <br>Other tales speculate he was a man driven to insanity by excessively long lines at government municiple buildings... <br>Rumors have been heard that he is the ultimate human: one who was born from an unholy union between opposing groups of cussed and punchable people. Could a stage theater arts major REALLY have married a wannabe film critic? Could a liberal Democrat have found love with the most conservative of Republicans? Could a vocal vegan, and the most fervent of flat-Earthers forged a child with all the powers and abilities of those blood-pressure-raising parents?<br>...Some even wisper that he is not a human at all, but a traveler from the stars, whose intellect was driven past the breaking point when their sensors first picked up radio signals that contained the widly varied, and often hipocritical, culture of humans.<br><br>
